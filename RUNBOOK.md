# Practice Logs — Update Runbook

*A hand-off guide for Claude Cowork. Everything needed to refresh the meditation
practice-log database and republish it. Replaces the old `Legacy/` scripts.*

> **Resuming? Read `PROGRESS.txt` first.** It's the on-disk checkpoint of what the
> last session did and what's left. Keep it updated as you work (see §11).

## 1. What this project is

A searchable database of meditation practice logs scraped from the **Dharma
Overground** (DhO) forum and the **Kenneth Folk Dharma** (KFD) archive. Each log
is labelled (attainment, techniques, themes, quality grades, etc.) and published
as a single filterable table at **johnduality.net/practice-logs/**, rendered by
`index.html`.

**Canonical data store:** `logs.json` — one JSON record per log, list-valued
fields (themes, techniques, teachers) kept as arrays.
**Publishing:** the records are embedded inline into `index.html` as a
`const DATA = [ ... ];` array. There is no spreadsheet in the loop anymore.

Pipeline at a glance:

```
DhO board ──(browser)──► per-thread .txt ──(label)──► logs.json ──(embed)──► index.html
```

    ├── extract_snippet.js             # paste-run in Claude in Chrome to capture a thread
    ├── process_payload.py             # captured JSON  ->  formatted .txt

```

The DhO board folder is **date-stamped** (e.g. `DhO Practice Logs Board 25-10-15`).
That date is the **cutoff**: everything up to it is already captured. **Always stamp
the folder with the day *before* the run** (i.e. "yesterday"), never the run day
itself — this guarantees full capture by forcing a re-scrape of any thread updated
on the boundary day (a same-day stamp could miss threads replied to later that day,
across time zones). Duplicates are harmless: a re-captured thread just overwrites
its own `.txt`.

---

## 3. Why the scraping method changed

The old `Legacy/1 - DhO Log Downloader.py` fetched pages with Python `requests`.
**DhO now sits behind Cloudflare, which blocks `requests`** (and any server-side
fetch, including this sandbox). A real signed-in browser passes Cloudflare
normally, so we drive **Claude in Chrome** to load each page, capture the message
HTML from the live DOM, and convert it locally. Everything downstream is unchanged.

### The browser→disk hand-off (this is the part that used to fail)

Getting captured text out of the browser onto disk has three traps. All are now
handled by the tools here; the reliable pattern is **stash every thread in
`localStorage`, then do ONE download per run from a fresh tab.**

- **Trap 1 — the tool-output channel blocks page data.** Returning captured
  HTML/JSON through the `javascript_tool` result trips a safety filter
  ("[BLOCKED: Cookie/query string data]" / base64), because forum posts are full of
  query-string URLs. It's also size-capped (~30k). **So the snippets never return
  page content — only a tiny status.** (`get_page_text` is unfiltered but hard-capped
  at 50,000 chars even in its persisted file, so it's not a general answer either.)
- **Trap 2 — Chrome's multi-download gate.** The FIRST automatic (blob) download in a
  browser tab succeeds; every later one in that same tab is silently blocked (no
  error, no file). So a per-thread download design dies after thread #1.
  **Fix: accumulate all threads in `localStorage` (it persists across same-origin
  navigations and is shared across tabs), then trigger exactly ONE combined download
  — and do it from a freshly-opened tab, which resets the gate.** Verified reliable.
- **Trap 3 — the thread-title selector changed.** The old `h1.header-title` is gone.
  Title now comes from `document.title` minus the
  ` - Discussion - www.dharmaoverground.org` suffix (HTML-unescaped). Handled in
  the snippet + `process_payload.py`.

---

## 4. Prerequisites

- **Claude in Chrome** extension connected and signed in with the same account.
- **Downloads folder access** — grant it with `request_cowork_directory`
  (host path e.g. `C:\Users\johnl\Downloads`). This is the drop point for
  captured payloads.
- Being logged into DhO in that Chrome isn't required for public logs, but doesn't hurt.

---

## 5. Update workflow (incremental — the usual case)

### Step 1 — Find the cutoff
Read the date in the `Data/DhO Practice Logs Board YY-MM-DD/` folder name. Any
thread whose **latest reply is on or after that date** needs (re)capturing — the
date is inclusive, and because the folder is stamped to the day before the previous
run (see §2), this re-scrapes the boundary day and guarantees nothing is missed.

### Step 2 — Collect new / updated threads from the board
- **Board URL:** `https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/category/2658626`
- The board is sorted by **most-recent reply first**, so new activity is at the
  top. (~768 threads, 40 per page, ~20 pages — but you'll only ever walk the
  first page or two before hitting threads older than the cutoff.)
- **Selectors** (verified current):
  - each thread row → `li.list-group-item`
  - title + link → `h2.h5 > a`  (`a.textContent` = title, `a.href` = thread URL)
  - recency shows as text like `"… replied 2 Hours ago."`
- Walk from page 1, collect `{title, url}` for every thread whose last reply is
  after the cutoff. Stop once you reach threads older than the cutoff. To page,
  either click the **Next Page** control in Chrome or append the board's page
  cursor. A thread already captured but with **new replies** should be re-captured
  (it will simply overwrite its `.txt` and its `logs.json` record).

### Step 3 — Capture + convert each thread
Capture ALL the run's threads first (into `localStorage`), then hand them off in a
single download. Do **not** download per thread (Trap 2 above).

1. For each `{title, url}`: navigate Claude in Chrome to `url` (this passes
   Cloudflare), then run `Tools/extract_snippet.js` via `javascript_tool`. It
   captures the title + every message's `{usernameRaw, contentHTML}`, stashes the
   payload in `localStorage` under `cap_dho_<threadId>`, and returns only a small
   status (message count, etc.). If it reports `ready:false`, the page hadn't
   finished rendering — wait a moment and re-run it.
2. When every thread for this run is captured, **open a NEW tab, navigate it to any
   dharmaoverground.org page, and run `Tools/combine_download.js` once.** It bundles
   all `cap_*` payloads into a single `dho_capture.json` and triggers ONE download to
   the Downloads folder. (Fresh tab + single download = always lands.)
3. Convert the whole bundle at once:
   ```
   python3 Tools/process_payload.py <Downloads>/dho_capture.json "Data/DhO Practice Logs Board <new-date>"
   ```
   → writes one `<Title>.txt` per thread in the exact legacy format.
   `process_payload.py` accepts either the bundle or a single-thread payload.

*Large runs:* `localStorage` holds ~5 MB per origin. For a big rebuild, download and
clear (`localStorage.clear()`) every ~30–40 threads rather than accumulating all at once.

*awakenetwork.org "special additions"* (client-rendered magazine articles, e.g. Chris
Marti's journals): use `Tools/extract_awakenetwork.js` instead — it parses the article
in-browser into finished log text and stashes it under `cap_txt_<slug>`. The same
`combine_download.js` + `process_payload.py` hand-off then writes the `.txt` files.

**What `process_payload.py` reproduces (format spec):**
```
Title: <thread title>
URL: <thread url>

User: <name>

<message text, whitespace-collapsed>
---

User: <name>
...
```
- Message blocks come from `div.card.panel` containing `div.message-content`.
- Username = `h5.message-user-display` text up to the first comma.
- Quotes render as `<quote> … </quote>` blocks (blank line before/after).
- **Nested (double) quotes are preserved** as nested `<quote><quote>…</quote>…</quote>`
  — processed deepest-first. Single quotes and quote-free text are **byte-identical**
  to the legacy scraper (verified by diffing a re-scrape against the old corpus:
  the only differences were the new posts and the one nested-quote message).
- Filenames keep only alphanumerics, space, hyphen, underscore, then rstrip — so
  apostrophes drop (`John's Log` → `Johns Log.txt`). Keep this rule for consistency
  with the existing corpus.

### Step 4 — Label each new log
**You (Cowork Claude) do the labelling directly — no API key, no external call.**
Read the `.txt` and produce the record following **`Tools/subagent_prompt.md`** (the
rubric + schema; see §7). For a handful of new logs, label them inline; for a large
batch, fan out to subagents as in §9. Output exactly the schema fields, nothing else.

### Step 5 — Build each record and update `logs.json`
Turn the labels into one JSON record per log using the schema + derivations in
**§6**. Then, keyed by `URL`: replace the record if it already exists in
`logs.json`, otherwise append it.

### Step 6 — Republish
```
python3 Tools/build_index.py logs.json index.html
```
This swaps the new records into `index.html`'s `const DATA = [...]` block
(bracket-depth scan; safe against brackets inside strings). Open `index.html` to
confirm the row count and spot-check a few rows. Then rename the Data board folder
to **the day before this run** (yesterday's date), per the cutoff convention in §2.

---

## 6. `logs.json` record schema

One object per log, **`snake_case` keys** — this is the shape `index.html` consumes.
The field-by-field definitions, types, and example live in **`Tools/subagent_prompt.md`**
(the single source of truth); they're not duplicated here. Four keys are *derived* rather
than labelled: `log` (title), `url` (line-2 URL), `source` (`"DhO"`/`"KFD"`), and
`exp_years` (a number from `practice_experience`). Numeric fields (`usefulness`,
`non_author_advice_quality`, `practice_volume`, `spice`, `exp_years`) are JSON numbers so
`index.html` sorts/filters them numerically; `practice_experience` is a display string;
list fields are arrays; everything else is a string.

**index.html:** already migrated to this snake_case, numeric schema — its `COLS`,
`ATT` list (`no attainment / A&P / Dark Night / Equanimity / 1st–4th path`, no `pre-1st`
stages), and the numeric 1–10 colour buckets all match. So routine publishing is just
`build_index.py` injecting `DATA`; no JS changes are needed unless the schema changes
again.

---

## 7. Labelling rubric

The full rubric — diagnostic criteria, every field, the JSON output schema, and a
worked example — lives in **`Tools/subagent_prompt.md`**, kept separate so the many
labelling subagents read only that small file and never this whole runbook. That
file is the single source of truth for labelling; edit it there, not here.

---

## 8. Full rebuild (re-process every `.txt` into a fresh `logs.json`)

To rebuild from scratch (e.g. first population, or after a labelling-rubric change):

1. Gather every `.txt` under `Data/` (DhO board + KFD + Additional).
2. For each, label it (§7) and build a record (§6). Set `source` to `"DhO"` or
   `"KFD"` based on which folder it came from; `url` is on line 2 of each `.txt`.
3. Write all records to `logs.json`.
4. `python3 Tools/build_index.py logs.json index.html`.

This is a large batch (~950 logs). Do it in chunks, save `logs.json` incrementally,
and keep a note of the last file processed so it can resume. Skip any non-log index
files (e.g. a combined "AI-Sorted Database" text, if present).

---

## 9. Parallel labelling (subagent fan-out)

Labelling the whole corpus (~950 logs) is slow in one thread — parallelize it.
Spawn several **subagents**, each handling a batch of `.txt` files, each returning
a JSON array of records. The orchestrator merges them into `logs.json`.

**Orchestrator (main agent) steps:**
1. List the target `.txt` files (all of `Data/**` for a full rebuild, or just the
   newly-exported ones for an incremental update).
2. Split into batches of **at most 5 files** per subagent.
3. Spawn one subagent per batch **in parallel**, passing that batch's file paths
   and a shared output folder (e.g. `Tools/label_parts/`).
4. When all return, concatenate every `part_*.json`, **replace-by-`URL`** against
   any existing `logs.json`, and write `logs.json`.
5. `python3 Tools/build_index.py logs.json index.html`.

**Subagent prompt:** hand each subagent the contents of **`Tools/subagent_prompt.md`**
with its two placeholders filled in — `{{LOG_FILES}}` (that batch's ≤5 `.txt` paths)
and `{{OUTPUT_PATH}}` (e.g. `Tools/label_parts/part_03.json`). That file is fully
self-contained (context, rubric, schema, worked example, and write/validate
instructions), so subagents never open this runbook.

**Notes:**
- Cap batches at **5 logs per subagent**. Some logs exceed 300 KB, so keeping
  batches small ensures every log fits comfortably in the subagent's context; drop
  below 5 if a batch happens to contain several very large logs.
- **Avoid clustering same-author logs in one batch.** Many authors have multiple
  threads (numbered parts, "Reboot", "MIGRATE" duplicates, monthly journal
  installments — often detectable from filename patterns like "Name log 2",
  "Name log 3"). When forming batches, spread suspected same-author files across
  *different* subagent calls, or label them one-file-per-subagent, rather than
  handing several of one person's logs to a single subagent. Verified failure mode:
  a subagent given multiple logs by the same author has blended details (e.g. a
  technique or attainment from a later log bleeding into an earlier log's record)
  even though each record is supposed to reflect only its own file — see the
  contamination warning baked into `Tools/subagent_prompt.md`'s Rules section. That
  warning is a safety net, not a substitute for avoiding the clustering up front.
- Have the orchestrator verify the final `logs.json` count matches the number of
  input files (minus intended skips) before running `build_index.py`.

## 10. Reference: selectors

| Purpose            | Selector |
|--------------------|----------|
| Board thread rows  | `li.list-group-item` |
| Board title + link | `h2.h5 > a` |
| Thread messages    | `div.card.panel` (that contain a `div.message-content`) |
| Message author     | `h5.message-user-display` (text before first comma) |
| Message body       | `div.message-content` (innerHTML) |
| Quote block        | `div.quote` → `div.quote-content` (nested = deepest-first) |
| Thread title       | `document.title` minus ` - Discussion - www.dharmaoverground.org` |

---

## 11. Resuming across sessions — `PROGRESS.txt`

Cowork sessions don't share memory, so state lives on disk in **`PROGRESS.txt`**
(project root). It's the single hand-off note between sessions.

**Every session:**
1. **Read `PROGRESS.txt` first.** It tells you the current run's goal, phase
   (capture / convert / label / build), the DhO cutoff date, a checklist of items
   with `[ ]`/`[x]` status, and a one-line **NEXT ACTION**.
2. **Update it as you go** — flip a checklist item to `[x]` the moment its artifact
   exists on disk (a `.txt` written, a record added to `logs.json`, etc.), not at the
   end. Refresh **NEXT ACTION**, **Phase**, and **Last updated** each time.
3. If you start a new run, list its intended threads/files as `[ ]` up front; the
   remaining `[ ]` items are exactly the resume point if the run is interrupted.

Because each `.txt` is idempotent (a re-captured thread just overwrites its own file),
the safe recovery rule is simply: **redo any item still marked `[ ]`.** Keep entries
terse; append a dated one-liner to the LOG section for anything non-obvious.
